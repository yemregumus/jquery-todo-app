# Advanced jQuery To-Do List Application

## Overview

This project is an advanced To-Do List web application built using jQuery. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. The application demonstrates various jQuery features, including DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, local storage for data persistence, and advanced functionalities such as task filtering, sorting, and editing.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished by a strikethrough.
- **Edit Tasks**: Double-click on a task to edit its content. Press Enter or click outside to save the changes.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "X" button next to them.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to view all, only active (incomplete), or only completed tasks.
- **Clear Completed Tasks**: Completed tasks can be cleared from the list with a single button click.
- **Drag-and-Drop Sorting**: Tasks can be reordered by dragging and dropping them within the list.
- **Local Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across page reloads and browser sessions.
